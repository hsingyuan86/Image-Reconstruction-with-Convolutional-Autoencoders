# Image-Reconstruction-with-Convolutional-Autoencoders
Assignment for EE4685 Machine learning, a Bayesian perspective

In this project, we designed Convolutional Autoencoders and Variational autoencoders and trained them on images from Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The details are shown in `ConvAE_VAE_CIFAR10.ipynb` and `ConvAE_VAE_FashionMNIST.ipynb`.

The relationship between latent dimensions and test loss is investigated in `latent dimensions vs loss FMNIST.ipynb` and `latent dimensions vs loss CIFAR10.ipynb`
